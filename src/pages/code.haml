.intro
  I love code. Here are some projects I've worked on.

:markdown
  * I wrote and maintain [Scisr](http://youngian.github.com/Scisr/),
    a refactoring tool written in and for PHP.
  * I'm one of the lead developers on [GrinnellPlans](https://code.google.com/p/grinnellplans/),
    a homegrown social platform for members of the Grinnell College community.
    <aside>
      And for the record, Plans existed long before Web 2.0.

  * I worked on the [regular expression engine in Vim](https://code.google.com/p/vim-soc-regexp/),
    sponsored by Google Summer of Code.
